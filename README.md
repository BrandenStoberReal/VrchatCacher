# VRChat Cache Backup
Scans your VRChat cache and backs up all avatars and worlds to your Documents folder. They can be found under "Documents/VRChat Cache Backup". Only Windows is supported.

By default the program scans every 30 seconds. This is hardcoded for now as I see no reason to make it adjustable.

Requires ``.NET 8`` runtime.
